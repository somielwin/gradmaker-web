			                        				<p>You do not have to wait until your child is born. Just indicate your child is 0 years old.

			                                        <p>Your Beneficiary is the person who will receive the death benefit if you (the insured) die. There are 2 types of beneficiaries:</p>
			                                        <p><strong>Revocable Beneficiary</strong> - a revocable beneficiary means you are free to use the funds and change your chosen beneficiary without the need of your current beneficiary’s consent.</p>
			                                        <p><strong>Irrevocable Beneficiary</strong> - an irrevocable beneficiary means that you will need to seek approval from your beneficiary to change him/her to another beneficiary of your choice. You will also need his/her consent to withdraw the funds or make any changes to the policy.</p>
