		                        				<p>You do not have to wait until your child is born. Just indicate your child is 0 years old. This will allow you to proceed to the tuition fee calculator and begin the process. You may designate your spouse, parents, grandparents or siblings as your beneficiary for the mean time. You have the option to appoint your child as your beneficiary later on.</p>
		                                        <p>Your Beneficiary is the person who will receive the death benefit if you (the insured) die. There are 2 types of beneficiaries:</p>
		                                        <p><strong>Revocable Beneficiary</strong> - a revocable beneficiary means you are free to use the funds and change your chosen beneficiary without the need of your current beneficiary’s consent.</p>
		                                        <p><strong>Irrevocable Beneficiary</strong> - an irrevocable beneficiary means that you will need to seek approval from your beneficiary to change him/her to another beneficiary of your choice. You will also need his/her consent to withdraw the funds or make any changes to the policy.</p>

If your money sits in a savings account earning a small interest rate, inflation will continue to devalue your money. Taking in some risk by investing can possibly give you much higher returns that will allow you to beat inflation!</p>
