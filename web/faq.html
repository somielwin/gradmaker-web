										<h5>Variable Life Product</h5>
										<p>This is a product with investment and insurance combined. GradMaker is an example of a variable life product, so you have an investment and insurance at the same time. This is the advantage of GradMaker versus investments that you usually get from a bank. With GradMaker, you get insurance protection that you wouldn’t otherwise get from a pure investment product.</p>
										<h5>Premium</h5>
										<p>This is the amount that you pay for an investment/insurance policy. In short, what you pay us (Manulife) for your GradMaker Policy.</p>
										<h5>Account Value	</h5>
										<p>This is the worth of your investment at a given point in time.</p>
										<h5>Death Benefit	</h5>
										<p>If you die, this is the amount of money that your beneficiary gets.</p>
										<h5>Beneficiary	</h5>
										<p>This is the person who receives the death benefit.</p>
										<h5>Trustee</h5>
										<p>This is the person who holds or administers the death benefit for a minor beneficiary.</p>
										<h5>Surrender Charges		</h5>
										<p>This is the fee deducted from your Account Value if you withdraw this within a certain period.</p>
										<h5>Maturity Date	</h5>
										<p>This is the date upon which the Account Value will be paid out to you.</p>

								<h4 class="faq-title">Understand GradMaker</h4>
								<div class="faq-expand" style="display: block;">
									<article style="opacity: 1; visibility: visible;">
										<h5>What is GradMaker?</h5>
										<p>The GradMaker product is a Single Premium product, meaning the policy is paid in full at the time of purchase. You are able to purchase additional policies at any time. </p>
										<h5>What are the product benefits of GradMaker?</h5>
										<p>With GradMaker, you can invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds which can help your money achieve long-term growth. </p>
										<p>Your family is also protected so that in case of your untimely demise, your child or your chosen beneficiary will get at least 125% of your single premium even if the market is down.</p>
										<h5>What is the difference of GradMaker with Pre-need Education Plans?</h5>
										<p>Most of the companies who offered old Pre-Need Education plans promised and guaranteed to fully cover the cost of tuition fees, whatever that amount may be, as long as clients paid their premiums. However, come actual payout time, those companies were confronted with high tuition fees that exceeded their projections; hence they were unable to deliver their promise to their plan holders.</p>
										<p>GradMaker is an entirely different concept because GradMaker is a product that allows you to invest in a professionally-managed fund. This way, you can take advantage of the growth in the economy and beat inflation. But as with any investment, we fully disclose to our prospect clients that there are <strong>NO GUARANTEES</strong>. We are transparent on how your money is invested and on how the fund performs everyday. Through GradMaker, you can also monitor how much your money is worth at any given time, and you can even withdraw your money when you need it.</p>

										<h5>What is the insurance benefit of GradMaker?</h5>

										<p>Note: There is an annual fund management fee of 2.25% to cover the cost of managing the fund.  This is already reflected in the Unit prices.</p>
										<h5>When will my policy mature?</h5>
										<p>At the end of the 25th year, your plan will mature and the account value will be paid out to you.</p>
										<h5>What IDs are considered valid?	</h5>

										<p>Yes but note that a surrender charge of 2% will be deducted from your Account Value if you withdraw this within the first 5 years. </p>
										<h5>How do I cancel my purchase?	</h5>
										<p>Go to your individual plans page, slide to the left the policy that you want to cancel then choose how you want to get the proceeds of your investment.</p>
										<h5>I bought 3 GradMaker policies.  How will be the surrender charge applied?</h5>
										<p>The surrender charge will apply to each investment made even if these are all withdrawn at once.</p>

										<h5>Where is my money invested?</h5>
										<p>Your money will be invested in Peso Dynamic Allocation Fund which can help you grow your money over the long term.  How much you will earn depends on the performance of this fund.  The fund invests in a combination of the following:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Government bonds;</li>
											<li>High-quality corporate bonds; and</li>
											<li>Stocks listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange</li>
										</ul>
										<h5>I’m not a risk taker, is GradMaker a suitable product for me?</h5>
										<p>GradMaker is designed for those who are willing to take a certain degree of risk in exchange for higher potential earnings.  </p>
										<h5>How has the fund performed historically?	</h5>
										<p>As of June 30, 2016, the fund has earned the following absolute returns (not annualized):</p>
										<ul class="no-style performed-history">
											<li><span>Full Year 2014   </span> <span class="ph-detail">11.53%</span></li>
											<li><span>Full Year 2015 </span> <span class="ph-detail"> -4.89%</span></li>
											<li><span>YTD as of June 30, 2016 </span> <span class="ph-detail">   8.60%</span></li>
											<li><span>Since inception (July 1, 2013) </span> <span class="ph-detail"> 9.90%</span></li>
										</ul>
										<p>However, this does not guarantee how much you will earn in the future.</p>
										<h5>Why should I invest instead of keeping my money in the bank?</h5>
										<ul class="check-list">
											<li>Investing allows you to take advantage of the growth in the economy and beat inflation.  </li>
											<li>Returns on time deposits or special deposit accounts range from only 1-2%, while the returns on the Peso Dynamic Allocation Fund reached ~11% in 2014.</li>
										</ul>
										<h5>Is the return on my investment guaranteed?</h5>
										<p>The return on your investment is <strong>not guaranteed</strong>.  As the owner, you shall bear all investment risks associated with this product.  Depending on the performance of the fund, the value of your investment can be higher or lower than what you paid for.  However, research has shown that investments in bonds and stocks go up in value over time for those who are prepared to buy and hold long-term (i.e. at least 5 to 7 years).</p>
										<h5>How long should I keep my investment?</h5>
										<p>For GradMaker, it is recommended to remain invested for at least 5 years to avoid surrender charges and to be able to maximize the gains on your investment.</p>
										<h5>How do I compute for my account value?</h5>
										<p>This is where you can find your account value. <br> This is the formula:	Account Value = number of Units X current Unit Price <br> Units represent your ownership in the fund while Unit price is the value of each unit. The Unit Price usually changes depending on the market performance. <br>Here’s a scenario: </p>
										<ol>
											<li>You invested Php10,000 in GradMaker and at the time of purchase the current Unit price was P20.<br>Account Value = Php10,000</li>
											<li>To get the number of units you bought, divide your investment (Php10,000)  by the Unit Price (Php20). So in this case that’s 500 units that you own.<br>10,000/20 = 500 Units</li>
											<li>Three months later, the Unit Price increased to Php22.</li>
											<li>This means that your 500 units should now be multiplied by the current Unit Price of P22.
											<br>500 x 22 = Php11,000<br>So your Account Value increased from Php10,000 to Php11,000.
											</li
											>
										</ol>
										<h5>What will I do if the unit price drops?	</h5>
										<p>When the Unit price drops, do not be alarmed.  You may remain invested until the unit price bounces back.  This is why we recommend that you hold your investment for a period of at least 5 to 10 years so that your Account Value may grow over time.</p>
										<h5>How do I know what the current Unit Price is?</h5>
										<ul>
											<li>On PRINT - every Thursday at the Business Section of the Philippine Star. </li>
											<li>ONLINE - daily at http://www.manulife.com.ph/Check-Fund-Performance. </li>
										</ul>
										<h5>When will my money be invested?	</h5>
										<p>Your money will be invested on the next business day following your application. If your purchase was made between 10pm-12am, your money will be invested after two business days. The date of investment is the effective date of your policy.</p>
